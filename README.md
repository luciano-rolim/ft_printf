# ft_printf
- This repository consists in the project ft_printf, which objective is to partially replicate the behavior of the original printf function in C.
- To test it, I also created a custom int main with different test scenarios. You will find it at the file test_ft_printf.c. Just copy and paste the function in any file on the same folder and compile/execute all .c files **without the flags**, otherwise some test scenarios will not be approved by the compiler.
- I also used [printfTester](url) to test it too.
